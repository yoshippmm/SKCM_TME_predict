Tips for Preparing a Successful Data and Codes Access Request

1, Research Use Statement. 
The approval of project data and codes requests depends primarily on a carefully written Research Use Statement (2,000 characters max). 
The statement should include the following components:
• Objectives of the proposed research; 
• Study design; 
• Analysis plan; 
• Explanation of how the proposed research is consistent with the data or codes of this reposit; and 
• Brief description of any planned collaboration with researchers at other institutions, including the name of the collaborator(s) and their institution(s).

2, Non-Commercial Use Declaration. 
As part of the request, investigators should provide a non-commercial use declaration with the signature of Principal investigators (PIs).

3, Detailed Contact Information for Applicant and Collaborators
Plsease provide the full legal names and contact information for the applicant and all the collaborators (if appliable).
